This is an analytics project to execute different data analysis concepts and derive  insights from the COVID 19 data provided by the John Hopkin's Corona Virus resource centre. 

We have used interactive plotly graphs to plot date wise analysis and derive insights of COVID 19 cases for 188 countries.
